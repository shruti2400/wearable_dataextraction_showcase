## üìç Project Overview

The **Wearable Data Extraction API** is an automated system built to scrape, clean, and visualize product data from major wearable brands ‚Äî **BoAt**, **Boult**, and **Noise**.

This project extracts product-related data (features, specifications, reviews, FAQs, and details) from brand websites, processes it into clean datasets, and automates the uploading of the final results to **OneDrive** for **Power BI dashboard** visualization.

It includes both **automatic scheduled scraping** and **manual API endpoints** for on-demand scraping.



## üéØ What This Project Does

1. **Web Scraping:**  
   Each brand (BoAt, Boult, Noise) has its own Selenium-based scraper.  
   The scraper automatically reads category URLs from a CSV input file and extracts data such as:
   - Product details  
   - Specifications  
   - Features  
   - FAQs  
   - Customer reviews  

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   The raw scraped data passes through multiple cleaner scripts inside the `preprocessor` folder.  
   Each script removes duplicates, fixes formatting issues, and standardizes data across all categories.

3. **Data Storage:**  
   The cleaned data from all categories of a brand are merged and stored inside a `merged_data` folder within that brand‚Äôs directory.  
   (No database is used ‚Äî all files are stored as CSV outputs.)

4. **Automation & Uploading:**  
   The project is integrated with **n8n**, a workflow automation tool.  
   After every successful run, **n8n automatically uploads the cleaned CSV files to OneDrive**.

5. **Visualization:**  
   Power BI dashboards are connected to the OneDrive data folder to visualize the latest cleaned data for each brand.
