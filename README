## 📍 Project Overview  

The **Wearable Data Extraction API** is a fully automated system designed to **scrape, preprocess, and visualize product data** from leading wearable brands — **BoAt**, **Boult**, and **Noise**.  

This project extracts rich product-level data (features, specifications, reviews, FAQs, and product details) directly from brand websites, cleans and merges them into structured datasets, and then **automatically uploads** the final outputs to **OneDrive** for **Power BI dashboard visualization**.  

It supports both **automatic scheduled scraping** and **manual API endpoints** for on-demand scraping — enabling smooth, flexible, and continuous data collection.

## 🎯 What This Project Does  

### 🕸️ 1. Web Scraping  
Each brand (BoAt, Boult, Noise) has its own **Selenium-based scraper** located inside the `scrapers/` folder.  
The scraper:
- Automatically reads category URLs from the `categories.csv` input file  
- Extracts multiple data types:
  - 🏷️ Product details  
  - ⚙️ Specifications  
  - ⭐ Customer reviews  
  - 💬 FAQs  
  - ✨ Features  

---

### 🧹 2. Preprocessing  
After scraping, raw data passes through a sequence of **cleaner scripts** stored in the `preprocessor/` folder.  
Each script:
- Removes duplicates  
- Fixes text and encoding issues  
- Standardizes formats across all brands  
- Ensures consistency before merging  

---

### 💾 3. Data Storage  
Cleaned data from all categories of a single brand are **merged** and stored inside the `merged_data/` directory under that brand’s folder.  
- No database is used — all processed outputs are stored as **CSV files**.  
- The merged files act as the **final, analytics-ready datasets** for dashboard integration.  

---

### ⚙️ 4. Automation & Uploading  
The project integrates seamlessly with **n8n**, an open-source automation workflow tool.  
- After every successful scraping and preprocessing run,  
  **n8n automatically uploads the cleaned and merged CSV files to OneDrive**.  
- This ensures that Power BI always has access to the most up-to-date data without manual effort.  

---

### 📊 5. Visualization  
The final datasets stored on OneDrive are connected to **Power BI dashboards**, enabling:  
- 📈 Brand-wise insights (BoAt, Boult, Noise)  
- 🧩 Comparative analysis across features and pricing  
- ⭐ Customer sentiment and review trend visualization  
- 📅 Automated dashboard refresh using OneDrive-linked data  

---

✨ This end-to-end system eliminates manual data collection, guarantees consistent cleaning, and automates data flow from **web to dashboard** — all with minimal supervision.
